Hello everyone, It's K3K here. It's been 4 months since I joined MoMo(M_Service) as a Software Engineer.

Last week, they started a learning campaign and gave me a Pluralsight subscription.

### So what do I do with it?

I was thinking about what skill should I develop with this opportunity. 

Since we are using Kotlin for backend development, and that the language does work with Java APIs, I figure getting Java knowledge would be beneficial.

 So I started my search for a good course to follow.

Pluralsight has this feature called "Paths" which combines multiple courses into a curriculum to get a specific certification. The feature is especially handy because it's milestone-oriented - It's like Pluralsight will help you answer the question "Which should I learn if I want to achieve my certification?" and you just need to focus on learning.

I decided to follow the [
Java SE 11 Developer Certification (1Z0-819)](https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/certificate/java-se-11-developer-certification-1z0-819#) path because while we're at it, why not getting a certificate to prove that I actually learnt something and my time was well-spent?

This series of blogs will serve as my learning diary and study notes. I hope that you finds it of help :D
